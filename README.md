### Android Developer
I've been an Android developer since my university days. I remember my first application, an environment data collection application to analyze dream quality. It was amazing to build my first Android app.

I've worked in some companies and projects, involving PHP, ReactJS, MySQL, Angular, NodeJS and Android. However, my heart always was Android team. I decided in the last two years to focus only on Android, as my dream is to be an Android expert.
